   * We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
   * 
   * I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
   * 
   * Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number I picked is
   * higher or lower.
   * 
   * However, when you guess a particular number x, and you guess wrong, you pay
   * $x. You win the game when you guess the number I picked.
   * 
   * Given a particular n â‰¥ 1, find out how much money you need to have to
   * guarantee a win.
