  /*
   * Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement
   * strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.
   * 
   * Note:
   * 1. The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed
   * integer.
   * 2. You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary
   * representation.
   * 
   * Example 1: 
   * Input: 5 
   * Output: 2
   * 
   * Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits),
   * and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
   * 
   * Example 2: 
   * Input: 1 
   * Output: 0
   * 
   * Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and
   * its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
